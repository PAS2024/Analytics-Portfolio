# Bank Churn Analysis

## Home
Welcome to the **Bank Churn Analysis** project, which aims to address the challenge of customer retention and churn management using a dataset of customer demographics and banking information.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out via the **Get In Touch** section.

## Bank Churn Dataset
This dataset contains demographic and banking information for customers, focusing on their engagement with the bank.

### Problème
This dataset highlights the challenge of **customer retention** and managing **churn** (customer dropout). Factors such as **credit score**, **account balance**, **tenure**, and **customer engagement** can influence a customer's decision to leave the bank. Failure to anticipate these behaviors can result in revenue loss and a shrinking customer base.

### Solution
The model analyzes key variables (such as **balance**, **products used**, and **engagement**) to predict customer churn. The goal is to implement **targeted actions** like personalized offers to increase retention. Using **Power BI** for data visualization enables better decision-making to improve customer retention.

## Dataset Information
This dataset contains the following customer attributes:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname**: Customer's last name.
- **CreditScore**: Numerical credit score.
- **Geography**: Country of residence (France, Spain, or Germany).
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male or Female).
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: Customer’s account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of bank products used by the customer (e.g., savings account, credit card).
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer owns a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer’s estimated salary.
- **Exited**: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no).

## Tools
While initially ambitious, this project focuses on real-time data collection and maintenance, particularly for research or commercial use cases. The key tools include **Power BI** for data visualization and machine learning models for **churn prediction**.

### Our Setup
The project involves **real-time data visualizations** to track customer engagement and churn risks. We aim to provide actionable insights through dynamic reporting.
